# üöñ NYC Yellow Taxi Data ETL & Analytics Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview
The **NYC Yellow Taxi Data ETL & Analytics Dashboard** project processes over **77 million** taxi trip records from **JUNE 2019 to MAY 2021**.  
It performs **data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)** using **AWS Glue** and **PySpark**, stores the cleaned data in Amazon S3, and visualizes key transportation insights through an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.

The project is designed for **data-driven decision-making** by the **NYC Government** to improve transportation planning, policy-making, and public accessibility of taxi trip data.

## üìä ETL Workflow
1. **Extract**  
   - Read raw Yellow Taxi data from public/cross-account S3 bucket.
   
2. **Transform**  
   - Remove null/invalid values
   - Map `PULocationID` and `DOLocationID` to zone names
   - Calculate new fields:
   -tip_percentage` = `(tip_amount / fare_amount) * 100`
   -distance_bucket` (0‚Äì1 mile / 1‚Äì5 mile / 5‚Äì10 mile / 10+ mile)
   
3. **Load**  
   - Store cleaned, transformed data into the processed S3 bucket.
   - Automatically update Glue Data Catalog via crawler.

4. **Visualize**  
   - Connect **Power BI** to processed S3 data (via **Athena**) for dashboard creation.
